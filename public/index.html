      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

    <noscript>Endaoment is a new Community Foundation & public charity offering Donor-Advised Funds (DAFs) built atop the Ethereum blockchain, allowing you to donate to almost any U.S. nonprofit organization.
Our mission is to encourage and manage the charitable giving of cryptocurrency.

We're a California Nonprofit Public Benefit Corporation headquartered in San Francisco, federally tax-exempt under IRS revenue code section 501(c)(3).  All donations to Endaoment or Endaoment DAFs are tax-deductible to the fullest extent of the law. 

Endaoment is incubated by Framework Labs, a leader in the decentralized finance industry and sister company of investment firm Framework Ventures. Our on-chain smart contracts have been audited by OpenZeppelin and our application interfaces have been built to leverage services and tools native to the DeFi industry. We'll be rolling out more features down the road that double-down on making a Community Foundation built for the DeFi community.
You can create a DAF on the Ethereum Mainnet at via our app, test out our latest build on the Ropsten test network, or join us on Discord if you have any questions!</noscript>
